# BeamTab

BeamTab is a Chrome extension that lets you "beam" your current tab to your other Chrome browsers. Unlike extensions like Pushbullet, it doesn't beam the tab to *all* of your Chrome devices but it lets you choose the device you want to send it to. 

BeamTab autogenerates your devices' names using some weird animal names, which you can change at any time by visiting the Options page.
