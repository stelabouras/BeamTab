# BeamTab

BeamTab is a Chrome extension that lets you "beam" your current tab to your other Chrome browsers. Unlike extensions like Pushbullet, it doesn't beam the tab to *all* of your Chrome devices but it lets you choose the device you want to send it to. 

BeamTab autogenerates the name of your devices using silly name but you can change them at any time by visiting the Options page.


## Major thanks

* [Stavros Korokythakis]() for his amazing queue service


## Todo / Future

* Add context menus integration
* Deal with the scroll position here and store it inside the Beam packet
* Internally deal with ids instead of device names (hash them?)
* Select recipient from selector using only the keyboard (up / down / enter)
