Google Storage Sync -> really slow
Pusher.io			-> not able to generate events from JS for a Chrome Extension
Bsync				-> not working, saving but not able to receive
PubNub				-> works, super fast, but pricy
Gtweet				-> works, fast, free, no js lib but minimum amount of code written

TODO:

* Add context menus integration
* Deal with the scroll position here and store it inside the Beam packet
* Internally deal with ids instead of device names (hash them?)
* Select recipient from selector using only the keyboard (up / down / enter)
